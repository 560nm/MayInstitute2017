# Objectives

- Hypothesis testing: t-test
- Categorical data
- Power calculation
- Linear models and correlation

---

# Statistical hypothesis test

First, we are going to prepare the session for further analyses.

```{r}
load("./data/summaryresults.rda")
load("./data/iprg.rda")
```

## Two sample t-test for one protein with one feature

Now, we'll perform a t-test whether protein `sp|P44015|VAC2_YEAST` has
a change in abundance between Condition 1 and Condition 2.

### Hypothesis

* $H_0$: no change in abundance, mean(Condition1) - mean(Condition2) = 0
* $H_a$: change in abundance, mean(Condition1) - mean(Condition 2) $\neq$ 0

### Statistics

* Observed $t = \frac{\mbox{difference of group means}}{\mbox{estimate of variation}} = \frac{(mean_{1} - mean_{2})}{SE} \sim t_{\alpha/2, df}$
* Standard error, $SE=\sqrt{\frac{s_{1}^2}{n_{1}} + \frac{s_{2}^2}{n_{2}}}$

with 

* $n_{1}$: number of replicates
* $s_{1}^2 = \frac{1}{n_{1}-1} \sum (Y_{1i} - \bar{Y_{1 \cdot}})^2$: sample variance

### Data preparation

```{r}
## Let's start with one protein, named "sp|P44015|VAC2_YEAST"
oneproteindata <- iprg[iprg$Protein == "sp|P44015|VAC2_YEAST", ]

## Then, get two conditions only, because t.test only works for two
## groups (conditions).
oneproteindata.condition12 <- oneproteindata[oneproteindata$Condition %in% 
                                             c('Condition1', 'Condition2'), ]
oneproteindata.condition12
table(oneproteindata.condition12[, c("Condition", "BioReplicate")])
```

If we want to remove the levels that are not relevant anymore, we can
use `droplevels`:

```{r}
oneproteindata.condition12 <- droplevels(oneproteindata.condition12)
table(oneproteindata.condition12[, c("Condition", "BioReplicate")])
```

To perform the t-test, we use the `t.test` function. Let's first
familiarise ourselves with it by looking that the manual 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?t.test
```

And now apply to to our data

```{r}
# t test for different abundance (log2Int) between Groups (Condition)
result <- t.test(Log2Intensity ~ Condition,
                 data = oneproteindata.condition12,
                 var.equal = FALSE)

result
```

> **Challenge**
>
> Repeat the t-test above but with calculating a 90% confidence interval
> for the log2 fold change.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
result.ci90 <- t.test(Log2Intensity ~ Condition, 
                      var.equal = FALSE,
                      data = oneproteindata.condition12,
                      conf.level = 0.9)
result.ci90
```

### The `htest` class

The `t.test` function, like other hypothesis testing function, return
a result of a type we haven't encountered yet, the `htest` class:

```{r}
class(result)
```

which stores typical results from such tests. Let's have a more
detailed look at what information we can learn from the results our
t-test. When we type the name of our `result` object, we get a short
textual summary, but the object contains more details:

```{r}
names(result)
```

and we can access each of these by using the `$` operator, like we
used to access a single column from a `data.frame`, but the `htest`
class is not a `data.frame` (it's actually a `list`). For example, to
access the group means, we would use

```{r}
result$estimate
```

> **Challenge**
> 
> * Calculate the (log2-transformed) fold change between groups
> * Extract the value of the t-statistics
> * Calculate the standard error (fold-change/t-statistics)
> * Extract the degrees of freedom (parameter)
> * Extract the p values
> * Extract the 95% confidence intervals


```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
## log2 fold-change
result$estimate[1]-result$estimate[2]
## test statistic value, T value
result$statistic 
## standard error
(result$estimate[1]-result$estimate[2])/result$statistic
## degree of freedom
result$parameter 
## p value for two-sides testing
result$p.value 
## 95% confidence interval for log2 fold change
result$conf.int 
```

We can also manually compute our t-test statistic using the formulas
we descibed above and compare it with the `summaryresult`.

Recall the `summaryresult` we generated last section

```{r}
summaryresult
summaryresult12 <- summaryresult[1:2, ]

## test statistic, It is the same as 'result$statistic' above.
diff(summaryresult12$mean) ## same as result$estimate[1]-result$estimate[2]
sqrt(sum(summaryresult12$sd^2/summaryresult12$length)) ## same as stand error

## the t-statistic
diff(summaryresult12$mean)/sqrt(sum(summaryresult12$sd^2/summaryresult12$length))
```

## Re-calculating the p values

See the previous
[*Working with statistical distributions*](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/MayInstitute/MayInstitute2017/blob/master/Program3_Intro%20stat%20in%20R/02-rstats.html#working_with_statistical_distributions)
for a reminder.

Referring back to our t-test results above, we can manually calculate
the one- and two-side tests p-values using the t-statistics and the
test parameter (using the `pt` function).


Our result t statistic was `r as.vector(result$statistic)` (accessible
with `result$statistic`). Let's start by visualising it along a t
distribution. Let's create data from such a distribution, making sure
we set to appropriate parameter.

```{r}
xt <- rt(1e5, result$parameter)
plot(density(xt), xlim = c(-10, 10))
abline(v = result$statistic, col = "red")
```

The area on the left of that point is given by `pt(result$statistic,
result$parameter)`, which is `r pt(result$statistic,
result$parameter)`. The p-value for a one-sided test is this given by

```{r}
1 - pt(result$statistic, result$parameter)
```

And the p-value for a two-sided test is 

```{r}
2 * (1 - pt(result$statistic, result$parameter))
```

which is the same as the one calculated by the t-test.




# Comparison of two proportions

For this part, we are going to use a new dataset, which contains the
patient information from TCGA colorectal cohort. This data is from
*Proteogenomic characterization of human colon and rectal cancer*
(Zhang et al. 2014).

Rows in the data array are patients and columns are patient
information. The column definition is shown as following:

| Variable            |
|---------------------|
| TCGA participant ID |
| Gender              |
| Cancer type         |
| BTAF mutation status|
| History of colon polyps |

## Generate 2-way contingency tables

We first need to calculate 2-way contingency tables for the
statistical tests.


Let's read in and explore the TCGA colorectal cancer data:

```{r}
TCGA.CRC <- read.csv("./data/TCGA_sample_information.csv")
head(TCGA.CRC)
```

We are interested in the cancer type and history of colon polyps;
let's select columns from TCGA dataset:

```{r}
TCGA.CRC.gc <- TCGA.CRC[, c('Cancer', 'history_of_colon_polyps')]
nrow(TCGA.CRC.gc)
```

and generate a 2-way contingency table using the `table` function and
visualise the count data

```{r}
ov <- table(TCGA.CRC.gc)
ov
dotchart(t(ov), xlab = "Observed counts")
```


## Chi-squared test

**Hypothesis** : 

$H_0$ : each population has the same proportion of observations, $\pi_{j=1|i=1} = \pi_{j=1|i=2}$

$H_a$ : different population have different proportion of observations


$$\chi^2 =\sum_{i=1}^2 \sum_{j=1}^2 \frac{(O_{ij}-E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}} \sim \chi^2_{(2-1)(2-1)}$$

$O_{ij}$ : $n_{ij}$, which is the count within the cells

$E_{ij}$ : $n_{i+}n_{+j}/n$, where $n_{i+}$ is the row count sum, $n_{+j}$ is the column count sum and n is the total count.


**Hypothesis**: whether the proportion of patients who have history of
colon polyps in the patients with colon cancer is different from that
in the patients with rectal cancer


```{r}
pt <- prop.test(ov)
pt

# name of output
names(pt)

# proportion in each group
pt$estimate 

# test statistic value
pt$statistic 

# degree of freedom
pt$parameter
```

## Fisher's exact test

The Fisher's exact test can be used with small sample sizes. It
compares distributions of counts within the 4 cells.

> **Challenge**
>
> Apply the Fisher's exact test using the `fisher.test` function and
> extract the odds ratio.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
#Fisher's Exact Test
ft <- fisher.test(ov) 
# odds ratio
ft$estimate 
```

## Z-test

Finally, we could also apply a z-test, defined as

$$Z=\frac{\widehat{\pi}_1-\widehat{\pi}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{\widehat{\pi}_1(1 - \widehat{\pi}_1)}{n_1}+\frac{\widehat{\pi_2}(1 - \widehat{\pi_2})}{n_2}}}$$

where $\widehat{\pi}_1 = \frac{y_{1}}{n_1}$ and $\widehat{\pi}_2 = \frac{y_{2}}{n_2}$.

We are going to use this test to illustrate how to write functions in
R. 

An R function is created with the function constructor, named
`function`, and is composed of:

1. a name: we will call our function to calculate the p-value
   `z.prop.p`;
2. some inputs: our inputs are the number of observations for the
   outcome of interest, `x1` and `x2`, and the total number of
   observation in each category, `n1` and `n2`;
3. a returned value (output): the computed p-value, named `pvalue`;
4. a body, i.e. the code that, given the inputs, calculates the output.


```{r}
z.prop.p <- function(x1, x2, n1, n2) {
    pi_1 <- x1/n1
    pi_2 <- x2/n2
    numerator <- pi_1 - pi_2
    denominator <- sqrt(((pi_1*(1-pi_1))/n1 + (pi_2*(1-pi_2))/n2))
    stat <- numerator/denominator
    pvalue <- 2 * (1 - pnorm(abs(stat)))
    return(pvalue)
}

z.prop.p(ov[1,1], ov[2,1], sum(ov[1,]), sum(ov[2,]))
```

Same as above, for the confidence interval at a given alpha level.

```{r}
z.prop.ci <- function(x1, x2, n1, n2, alpha = 0.05){
  pi_1 <- x1/n1
  pi_2 <- x2/n2
  numerator <- pi_1 - pi_2
  denominator <- sqrt(((pi_1*(1-pi_1))/n1 + (pi_2*(1-pi_2))/n2))
  cri_value <- qnorm(1-alpha/2)
  prop.ci <- c(numerator + cri_value * denominator,
               numerator - cri_value * denominator)
  return(prop.ci)
}

z.prop.ci(ov[1,1], ov[2,1], sum(ov[1,]), sum(ov[2,]))
```

> **Challenge**

> Write a function named `f2c` (`c2f`) that converts a temperature
> from Fahrenheit to Celsium (Celsium to Fahrenheit) using the
> following formula $F = C \times 1 + 32$ ($C = \frac{F - 32}{1.8}$).

# Sample size calculation

To calculate the required sample size, you’ll need to know four
things:

* $\alpha$: confidence level
* $power$: 1 - $\beta$, where $\beta$ is probability of a true positive discovery
* $\Delta$: anticipated fold change
* $\sigma$: anticipated variance

## R code

Assuming equal varaince and number of samples across groups, the
following formula is used for sample size estimation:

$$\frac{2{\sigma}^2}{n}\leq(\frac{\Delta}{z_{1-\beta}+z_{1-\alpha/2}})^2$$


```{r}
library("pwr")

## ?pwr.t.test

# Significance level alpha
alpha <- 0.05

# Power = 1 - beta
power <- 0.95

# anticipated log2 fold change 
delta <- 1

# anticipated variability
sigma <- 1.5

# Effect size
# It quantifies the size of the difference between two groups
d <- delta/sigma

#Sample size estimation
pwr.t.test(d = d, sig.level = alpha, power = power, type = 'two.sample')
```

Then, we investigate the effect of required fold change and variance on the sample size estimation.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# anticipated log2 fold change 
delta <- seq(0.1, 0.7, .1)
nd <- length(delta)

# anticipated variability
sigma <- seq(0.1,0.5,.1)
ns <- length(sigma)

# obtain sample sizes
samsize <- matrix(0, nrow=ns*nd, ncol = 3)
counter <- 0
for (i in 1:nd){
  for (j in 1:ns){
    result <- pwr.t.test(d = delta[i]/sigma[j],
                         sig.level = alpha, power = power,
                         type = "two.sample")
    counter <- counter + 1
    samsize[counter,1] <- delta[i]
    samsize[counter,2] <- sigma[j]
    samsize[counter,3] <- ceiling(result$n)
  }
}
colnames(samsize) <- c("fd","var","value")


library("ggplot2")
samsize <- as.data.frame(samsize)
samsize$var <- as.factor(samsize$var)
ggplot(data=samsize, aes(x=fd, y=value, group = var, colour = var)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(size=2, shape=21, fill="white") +
  labs(title="Sig=0.05 Power=0.05", x="Anticipated log2 fold change", y='Sample Size (n)') +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=20, colour="darkblue"),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size=15),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size=15),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size=13)) 
```


# Linear models and correlation


When considering correlations and modelling data, visualisation is key. 

Let's use the famous
[*Anscombe's quartet*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet)
data as a motivating example. This data is composed of 4 pairs of
values, $(x_1, y_1)$ to $(x_4, y_4)$:

```{r anscombe, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
library("knitr")
kable(anscombe)
```

Each of these $x$ and $y$ sets have the same variance, mean and
correlation:

```{r anscombetab, echo=FALSE}
tab <- matrix(NA, 5, 4)
colnames(tab) <- 1:4
rownames(tab) <- c("var(x)", "mean(x)",
                   "var(y)", "mean(y)",
                   "cor(x,y)")

for (i in 1:4)
    tab[, i] <- c(var(anscombe[, i]),
                  mean(anscombe[, i]),
                  var(anscombe[, i+4]),
                  mean(anscombe[, i+4]),
                  cor(anscombe[, i], anscombe[, i+4]))

```

```{r anstabdisplay, echo=FALSE}
kable(tab)
```

But...

While the *residuals* of the linear regression clearly indicate
fundamental differences in these data, the most simple and
straightforward approach is *visualisation* to highlight the
fundamental differences in the datasets.

```{r anscombefig, echo=FALSE}
ff <- y ~ x

mods <- setNames(as.list(1:4), paste0("lm", 1:4))

par(mfrow = c(2, 2), mar = c(4, 4, 1, 1))
for (i in 1:4) {
    ff[2:3] <- lapply(paste0(c("y","x"), i), as.name)
    plot(ff, data = anscombe, pch = 19, xlim = c(3, 19), ylim = c(3, 13))
    mods[[i]] <- lm(ff, data = anscombe)
    abline(mods[[i]])
}
```

## Correlation

Here is an example where a wide format comes very handy. We are going
to convert our iPRG data using the `spread` function from the `tidyr`
package:


```{r}
library("tidyr")
iprg2 <- spread(iprg[, 1:3], Run, Log2Intensity)
rownames(iprg2) <- iprg2$Protein
iprg2 <- iprg2[, -1]
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
save(iprg2, file = "./data/iprg2.rda")
```

And lets focus on the 3 runs, i.e. 2 replicates from condition
1 and 

```{r}
x <- iprg2[, c(1, 2, 10)]
head(x)
pairs(x)
```

We can use the `cor` function to calculate the Pearson correlation
between two vectors of the same length (making sure the order is
correct), or a dataframe. But, we have missing values in the data,
which will stop us from calculating the correlation:

```{r}
cor(x)
```

We first need to omit the proteins/rows that contain missing values

```{r}
x2 <- na.omit(x)
cor(x2)
```

### A note on correlation and replication

It is often assumed that high correlation is a halmark of good
replication. This is however a simplistic view. To illustrate this,
let's focus on the two first replicates, which have a high
correlation.

```{r}
r1 <- x2[, 1]
r2 <- x2[, 2]
cor(r1, r2)
```

Now lets assume we have a third replicate, `r3`. When we repeat a
measurement, we don't obtain exactly the same values. Let's add
normally distributed noise when creating a first thyroid replicate.

```{r}
r3a <- r1 + rnorm(length(r1))
```

Let's now create another third replicate, `r3b` that has a small noise
component, and a systematic biais.

```{r}
r3b <- r1 + rnorm(length(r1), 2, 0.5)
```

Which ones of `r1` and `r3a` or `r1` and `r3b` correlate better?

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
plot(r1, r3a, main = round(cor(r1, r3a), 3))
grid(); abline(0, 1, "red")
plot(r1, r3b, main = round(cor(r1, r3b), 3))
grid(); abline(0, 1, col = "red")
```

A better measurement would be to look a the log2 fold-changes,
i.e. the variation of our measurements:

```{r}
boxplot(data.frame(r1 - r3a, r1 - r3b))
```

## Linear modelling

On the plots above, `abline(0, 1)` was used to add a line with
intercept 0 and slop 1. It we want to add the line that models the
data linearly, we can calculate the parameters using the `lm`
function:

```{r}
lmod <- lm(r2 ~ r1)
lmod
```

which can be used to add the adequate line that reflects the (linear)
relationship between the two data

```{r}
plot(r1, r2)
abline(lmod, col = "red")
```

As we have seen in the beginning of this section, it is essential not
to rely solely on the correlation value, but look at the data. This
also holds true for linear (or any) modelling, which can be done by
plotting the model:

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(lmod)
```
